 <chapter id="introduction">
  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>
	This chapter introduces GTK-Doc and gives an overview of what it is and how it is used.
  </para>

  <sect1 id="whatisgtkdoc">
   <title>What is GTK-Doc?</title>

   <para>
   GTK-Doc is used to document C code. It is typically used to document the public
   API of libraries, such as the GTK+ and Gnome libraries. But it can also be
   used to document application code.
  </para>



  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="howdoesgtkdocwork">
   <title>How Does GTK-Doc Work?</title>

       <para>
GTK-Doc works by using documentation of functions placed inside the source files in
specially-formatted comment blocks, or documentation added to the template files
which GTK-Doc uses (though note that GTK-Doc will only document functions that
are declared in header files; it won't produce output for static functions).
Currently GTK-Doc does not support placing documentation of other types of
declarations, such as enums, macros, and structs, inside the source code.
  </para>

   <para>
GTK-Doc consists of a number of perl scripts, each performing a different step
in the process.
  </para>

  <para>
There are 5 main steps in the process:
  </para>

<orderedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>
<guilabel>Gathering information about the code.</guilabel>

   gtkdoc-scan scans the header files of the code looking for declarations of
   functions, macros, enums, structs, and unions. It creates a list of the
   declarations, placing them into sections according to which header file they
   are in. The author can rearrange the sections, and the order of the
   declarations within them, to produce the final desired order.

   gtkdoc-scanobj can also be used to dynamically query a library about
   any GtkObject subclasses it exports. It saves information about each
   object's position in the class hierarchy and about any GTK Args and Signals it
   provides.
  </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
<guilabel>Generating the "template" files.</guilabel>

   gtkdoc-mktmpl creates a number of files in the tmpl/ subdirectory, using the
   information gathered in the first step. (Note that this can be run
   repeatedly. It will try to ensure that no documentation is ever lost.)
  </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
<guilabel>Writing the documentation.</guilabel>

   The author fills in the template files with the documentation for each
function, macro, union etc.
  </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
<guilabel>Generating the SGML and HTML.</guilabel>

   gtkdoc-mkdb turns the template files into SGML files in the sgml/
   subdirectory.(If the source code contains documentation on functions, using the special
   comment blocks, it gets merged in here.)

   gtkdoc-mkhtml turns the SGML files into HTML files in the html/
   subdirectory.
  </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
<guilabel>Fixing up cross-references between documents.</guilabel>

   After installing the HTML files, gtkdoc-fixxref can be run to fix up any
   cross-references between separate documents. For example, the GTK+
documentation
   contains many cross-references to types documented in the GLib manual.

<guilabel>Modular DocBook Stylesheets</guilabel>
    This is the DSSSL code to convert DocBook to HTML (and a few other
    formats). It's used together with jade.
    I've customized the DSSSL code slightly, in gtk-doc.dsl, to colour
    the program code listings/declarations, and to support global
    cross-reference indices in the generated HTML.

   <para>
<guilabel>docbook-to-man</guilabel> - if you want to create man pages from the DocBook.
    I've customized the 'translation spec' slightly, to capitalise section
    headings and add the 'GTK Library' title at the top of the pages and the
    revision date at the bottom.
    There is a link to this on <ulink url="http://www.ora.com/davenport" type="http">http://www.ora.com/davenport</ulink>

   <title>Installation</title>
   <para>


There is no standard place where the DocBook Modular Stylesheets are installed.
   </para>
   <para>
gtk-doc's configure script searches these 3 directories automatically:
   </para>
   <para>
 <filename> /usr/lib/sgml/stylesheets/nwalsh-modular   </filename>     (used by RedHat)
   </para>
   <para>
 <filename>  /usr/lib/dsssl/stylesheets/docbook         </filename>     (used by Debian)
   </para>
   <para>
 <filename>  /usr/share/sgml/docbkdsl                   </filename>     (used by SuSE)

   </para>
   <para>
If you have the stylesheets installed somewhere else, you need to configure
gtk-doc using the option:

  <command> --with-dsssl-dir=&lt;PATH_TO_TOPLEVEL_STYLESHEETS_DIR&gt; </command>
