These are example build files which you can copy and modify for your app or
library. They were pinched from the GTK+ build files (thanks Owen!)

configure.in	- a check for gtk-doc which you can add to your configure.in

Makefile.am	- a basic Makefile.am. Copy to your project and modify the
		  variables at the top of the file.

		  Note that if your project is targeted at GTK+ 2.0 rather
		  than GTK+ 1.2.x, then you will have to change it so it
		  runs gtkdoc-scangobj rather than gtkdoc-scanobj.
