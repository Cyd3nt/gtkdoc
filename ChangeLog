2001-08-04  Damon Chaplin  <damon@ximian.com>

	* Released 0.7

2001-08-04  Damon Chaplin  <damon@ximian.com>

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in (OutputFunction): 
	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in (OutputDeclaration): patch from Lowell Johnson
	<ldjohn@usgs.gov> to accept things like "long long", "short int",
	"char test[][CLEN]" as function parameters.

2001-07-20  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnome.org>

	* gtkdoc-scangobj.in: Remove argument to g_type_init ();

2001-07-09  Damon Chaplin  <damon@ximian.com>

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in (ParseStructDeclaration): accept G_CONST_RETURN
	modifier for function return values. gtkdoc-mktmpl.in already had this.

Thu Jun 21 11:57:16 2001  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-scangobj.in: Conform to changes in GObject API
	for property retrieval.

2001-05-25  Peter Williams  <peterw@ximian.com>

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in (ScanSourceFile): Skip single-line comments -- 
	prevents barfing on ORBit-generated files.

2001-05-20  Damon Chaplin  <damon@ximian.com>

	* examples/Makefile.am (sgml-build.stamp): replaced use of wildcard
	(which isn't portable) with original *.sgml. I think this just means
	that the first time you try to build the docs it will fail, but if
	you run make again it will work.

	* doc/setting-up.txt: explained that make may fail the first time.

2001-05-19  Damon Chaplin  <damon@ximian.com>

	* README: 
	* doc/README:
	* doc/setting-up.txt:
	* doc/sections-file.txt:
	* doc/authors.txt: updated docs to cover simpler setup procedure.

	* doc/gtk_button.txt:
	* doc/manpage:
	* doc/manpage.man:
	* doc/notes.txt: removed out-of date stuff.

	* Makefile.am (dist-hook): updated so it doesn't try to remove old
	examples subdirectory stuff.

2001-05-19  Damon Chaplin  <damon@ximian.com>

	* examples/gnome/*:
	* examples/gnomeui/*: removed out-of-date example files.

	* examples/configure.in:
	* examples/Makefile.am: new example setup mostly copied from GTK+.

	* examples/README: describe the example configure.in/Makefile.am.

2001-05-19  Damon Chaplin  <damon@ximian.com>

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in: added --help option and changed output slightly to
	make more compatable with XML. Patch from Toshio Kuratomi
	<badger@prtr-13.ucsc.edu>

2001-05-19  Damon Chaplin  <damon@ximian.com>

	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in (OutputDeclaration): 
	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in (OutputFunction): changed a '?' to a '*' so we accept
	multi-dimensional array function parameters. Patch from Paolo Casarini
	<casarini@CS.UniBO.IT>

2001-05-12  Damon Chaplin  <damon@ximian.com>

	* gtkdoc-scangobj.in: 
	* gtkdoc-scanobj.in: used "*pos = 0" to avoid problems with backslashes
	in '\0'.

	* configure.in: removed dsssl dirs stuff, since we use public entities
	now.

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in (OutputBook): if there is no main SGML file we create
	it here. Also added a --main-sgml-file option so we know where to put
	it.

	* gtkdoc-scan.in: if there is no MODULE-sections.txt file, we copy
	the MODULE-decl-list.txt file to it. The user can tweak it later.

2001-05-11  Damon Chaplin  <damon@ximian.com>

	* gtk-doc.spec.in: applied patch from Toshio Kuratomi
	<badger@prtr-13.ucsc.edu>.

2001-05-07  Joakim Ziegler  <joakim@ximian.com>

  * gtkdoc-mkdb.in: Added option --outputallsymbols to create a symbol list
    in the module doc dir.

  * gtkdoc-mkdb.in: Added functionality to output a list of undocumented
    symbols in a module, most of is is in OutputMissingDocumentation.

  * gtkdoc-scan.in: Small scanning fixes to facilitate the doc coverage
     output mentioned above.

2001-04-25  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@ximian.com>

	* gtkdoc-scanobj.in: Added missing output-dir in the call to
	GetOptions().

2001-04-24  Damon Chaplin  <damon@ximian.com>

	* gtkdoc-scanobj.in: copied --outputdir option from gtkdoc-scangobj.in.

Fri Apr 13 15:25:44 2001  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in: Restore call to OutputBook that was accidentally
	deleted.

Thu Apr 12 17:57:12 2001  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-scangobj.in: Add a --outputdir option (sort of hacky.
	Need this because $CC, $LD can include relative paths if they
	are based on $LIBTOOL)

2001-03-26  Damon Chaplin  <damon@ximian.com>

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in (ReadSourceDocumentation): scan .h files as well,
	so macros can be documented there if desired. Patch from
	Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@mandrakesoft.com>

	* gtkdoc-mkhtml.in (gtkdocdir): use 'test -f' rather than 'test -e'
	which is GNU-specific.

Thu Mar  8 17:26:29 2001  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gtkdoc-scangobj.in: fix signal param type handling.

Tue Mar  6 23:21:46 2001  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-scanobj.in: Add gobject support.  Now works on files that
	don't link against GTK.

Sat Mar  3 17:43:42 2001  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-{scan,mktmpl,mkdb}.in: Add support for G_CONST_RETURN.
	(Right now, it will appear as G_CONST_RETURN in the output -
	I'm not sure that's right - perhaps it should be converted
	to const.)

2001-02-20  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in: s/TRUE/1/

2001-02-19  Damon Chaplin  <damon@ximian.com>

	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in (UpdateTemplates): fixed bug handling the $changed
	flag.

2001-02-17  Damon Chaplin  <damon@ximian.com>

	* gtkdoc-scan.in (ScanHeaders): 
	(ScanHeader): patch from Johannes Stezenbach <js@convergence.de>
	so we don't use '\b' in the regexp to match files/dirs to ignore.
	'\b' can match '_' so we matched things we shouldn't have.

Mon Feb 12 12:50:57 2001  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: Up version.

Sun Feb 11 18:35:07 2001  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in: Add a timestamp file for the
	templates like sgml.stamp

	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in (OutputUnusedTemplates): Write the
	symbols out in sorted order instead of hash table
	order to reduce conflicts.

Mon Feb  5 16:48:51 2001  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* configure.in gtk-doc.dsl.in: Remove checks for DSSSL - use a
	public entity instead.

	* gtkdoc-scangobj.in: Fix to work with libtool better.

2001-01-30  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* gtkdoc-fixxref.in, gtkdoc-mkdb.in, gtkdoc-mktmpl.in,
	gtkdoc-scan.in, gtkdoc-scangobj.in, gtkdoc-scanobj.in:	
	Added -*- cperl -*- magic, and --deprecated-guards
	option.

2001-01-23  Damon Chaplin  <damon@helixcode.com>

	* gtkdoc-scangobj.in: 
	* gtkdoc-scanobj.in: 
	* gtkdoc-scan.in: 
	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in: 
	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in: changed so that they only update files when
	necessary (they write new versions of the files out, then use 'cmp'
	to compare with the existing versions to see if they have changed.)
	This should make it easier to do proper dependency rules in Makefiles,
	and it may cut down on CVS traffic.

	* gtkdoc-mkhtml.in: update a timestamp file (html.stamp) after running.
	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in: update a timestamp file (sgml.stamp) if any of the
	DocBook SGML files have been changed. So hopefully you can now use
	rules like this to avoid unnecessary regeneration of the HTML:

	all-local:
		$(MAKE) scan
		$(MAKE) templates
		$(MAKE) sgml
		$(MAKE) html.stamp
	
	html.stamp: sgml.stamp $(EXTRA_SGML_FILES)
		$(MAKE) html

	(I've tried this with the old GTK+ reference API docs and it seems to
	work well.)

	* gtkdoc-scangobj.in: 
	* gtkdoc-scanobj.in: 
	* gtkdoc-scan.in: 
	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in: 
	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in:
	* gtkdoc-mkhtml.in:
	* gtkdoc-mkman.in:
	* gtkdoc-fixxref.in:
	Added '--version' command-line arg to all shell & perl scripts, so
	you can check for version 0.5 if you want to use the above rules.
	(If 0.4 is used make will probably complain about not knowing how to
	to build sgml.stamp.)

	* gtkdoc-common.pl.in: new file to contain shared routines.
	For now it just contains the UpdateFileIfChanged routine for the above.
	We can move the duplicated routines here in future, though the use of
	global variables makes this a bit awkward.

	* configure.in (PACKAGE_DATA_DIR): calculates the data dir and
	substitutes it so that the scripts know where gtkdoc-common.pl
	is installed. Also added gtkdoc-common.pl to AC_OUTPUT.

	* Makefile.am: added gtkdoc-common.pl to gtkdocdata_DATA.

	* gtkdoc-mkhtml.in: deleted the old index.sgml file, since it causes
	problems if it is owned by root (e.g. after you run 'make install' as
	root. jade prompts you about overwriting it, which is annoying.

2001-01-10  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in: Only move old file to backup if the old file
	exists, and have better error messages when doing the backups

Mon Jan  8 14:57:29 2001  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in: Canonicalize signal and argument
	names to -, not _.

	* gtkdoc-scangobj.in: Fix up for GParamSpec.

2001-01-04  Frédéric Gobry  <frederic.gobry@smartdata.ch>

	* gtkdoc-scan.in: fixed matching of < private_header > directive

2000-12-19  Damon Chaplin  <damon@helixcode.com>

	* gtkdoc-scanobj.in: 
	* gtkdoc-scangobj.in: added default cases to get_type_name().

2000-12-10  Arturo Tena  <arturo@directmail.org>

	* gtkdoc-scanobj.in (get_type_name): 
	* gtkdoc-scangobj.in (get_type_name): fixed syntax error: forgotten
	to close a switch statement.

2000-12-10  Damon Chaplin  <damon@helixcode.com>

	* gtk-doc.spec.in: added spec.in file from John Gotts
	<jgotts@linuxsavvy.com>.

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): added spec file.

	* Makefile.am: uncommented spec file stuff, now that we have one.

	* gtkdoc-scanobj.in (get_type_name): 
	* gtkdoc-scangobj.in (get_type_name): updated to use the type numbers
	rather than the type names, which were changed in GTK+ 1.2. This
	should fix a problem where GTK_TYPE_STRING arguments were output as
	'GtkString *arg' instead of 'gchar *arg'.

	I'm still not sure what to output for the structured types such as
	GTK_TYPE_SIGNAL/ARGS/FOREIGN/CALLBACK/C_CALLBACK. Should these be
	expanded to several arguments to the signal handler?

2000-11-25  Dan Mueth <d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

	* help/manual/C/: created this path
    * gtk-doc-manual.sgml: Put part of the outline into SGML.
      Chris plans to put rest of outline in here and start
      writing.
    * fdl-appendix.sgml: The FDL in SGML.  We will probably post
      these on the web as a single document (book) so we will
      need the FDL to be included as an appendix.

Fri Nov  3 07:21:34 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in:
	(ParseStructDeclaration):
	(OutputStruct):
	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in:
	(ParseStructDeclaration):
	support /*<protected>*/ equivalently to /*<private>*/

Fri Nov  3 07:15:58 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in: 
	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in:
	(ReadTemplateFile): only eat up the first space (if at all
	present) after "@param:" to preserve indentation for multiline
	parameter descriptions.

2000-10-30  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in (ParseStructDeclaration):
	Stop scanning at '}' only when it starts a line.
	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in (ParseStructDeclaration): Likewise.
	
Mon Oct 30 02:59:54 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gtkdoc-scangobj.in: use g_signal_list_ids().

Sun Oct 29 02:54:51 2000  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-scangobj.in: Sort signal types arrays for
	greater stability and less random tmpl file diffs.

Sun Oct 29 01:02:35 2000  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-scangobj.in: Work properly with GSignal

2000-10-21  Damon Chaplin  <damon@helixcode.com>

	* Released 0.4

2000-10-14  Damon Chaplin  <damon@helixcode.com>

	* AUTHORS: 
	* MAINTAINERS: changed my email address.

	* Makefile.am (dist-hook): remove the CVS dirs from the dist.

	* doc/setting-up.txt: typo.

Fri Oct  6 17:51:50 2000    <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-scan.in gtkdoc-mkdb.in: Allow multiple
	--source-dir options.

Thu Sep  7 11:41:12 2000  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in: Ignore all . files when scanning directories.

	* gtkdoc-scan.in: Add support for GLIB_VAR, GDKVAR,
	etc when looking for variable declarations. 

	* gtkdoc-scan.in: Recognize GET_CLASS macros.

	* gtkdoc-scangobj.in: Support .lo intermediate files
	with libtool.

Wed Sep  6 17:57:33 2000  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-scangobj.in: Add gtkdoc-scangobj scanner for
	GObject type system.

	* gtkdoc-scanobj.in: Allow setting $LD to allow separating
	compilation and linking and thus to allow using libtool.

	* gtkdoc-fixxref.in (ScanIndices): Allow HTMLDIR
	not to be present yet.

Tue Sep  5 23:37:53 2000  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-fixxref.in: Add a --extra-dir option to
	allow scanning of additional uninstalled HTML
	directories.

	* gtkdoc-scan.in (ScanHeaders): Honor subdirectories
	appearing in --ignore-headers.

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in: Append -CAPS to all all-caps identifiers
	to prevent an infinite expansion of special cases. 

	* gtkdoc-fixxref.in: Add a --module-dir option to
	allow fixing references in an uninstalled tree.

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in gtkdoc-mkhtml.in: Simple handling
	for macros with embedded commas in enumeration 
	declarations.

Mon Aug 28 18:18:53 2000  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* configure.in (DSSSL_DIR): Remove check for AM_PATH_GTK
	since the dependency is only run-time not install-time,
	and to avoid dependency loops.

2000-06-21  Damon Chaplin  <damon@helixcode.com>

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in: fixed <INCLUDES> bug, I think.

Wed Feb  9 11:29:25 2000  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-scan.in: Hack to avoid misidentifying structures
	as GtkObjects within Pango.

1999-12-15  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* gtk-doc.dsl.in ($generate-chapter-toc$): Add missing close
	paranthesis. 

1999-11-23  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* gtk-doc.dsl.in: Use the (define (foo) ...) syntax rather than
	the uglier (define foo (lambda () ...)) syntax.
	($generate-chapter-toc$): Simplify.
	($shade-verbatim-attr$): Simplify.  Use ($table-width$) instead of
	"100%" for width (See docs. of NWalsh Docbook DSSSL Stylesheets
	for an explanation).

1999-09-20  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* gtk-doc.dsl.in: If a Chapter has role="no-toc" we don't generate a
	table of contents. This is useful if a better contents page has been
	added manually, e.g. for the GTK+ Widgets & Objects page. (But it is
	a bit of a hack.)

	* gtkdoc-scanobj.in: added --nogtkinit flag which will make it call
	gtk_type_init() rather than gtk_init(). This is useful when it is
	run automatically to update the docs by a cron job or similar and a
	connection to an X server is not desirable. However, if any widgets
	need a connection to X in their class init function then this can't
	be used (e.g. GtkFontSelection at present).

Mon Sep 20 09:09:12 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in gtkdoc-mktmpl.in: (ParseStructDeclaration): 
	Fixed up the code to do /*< private >*/ ... stripping.

1999-09-10  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* gtkdoc.dsl.in ($generate-chapter-toc$): Return #t, not #f.

1999-09-09  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* gtkdoc-scan.in (ScanHeader): Don't force typedefs and other
	things to start in column 0; allow some spaces in front of them.
	Output `typedef struct { ... } name' structs as typedef, not as
	structure.

1999-09-08  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in (CreateValidSGMLID): `s/::/-/g;' for CORBA objects.

1999-08-22  Erik Walthinsen  <omega@cse.ogi.edu>

	* gtkdoc-scan.in: modified so it will find any Class, not just Gtk
	and Gnome classes.  Introduces the possibility of extraneous Class
	definitions (verified), which should be pruned somehow (haven't
	analyzed the false positive yet).

1999-08-22  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in: 
	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in: a few fixes to ParseStructDeclaration. It still
	has problems with nested structs/unions like those which occur in
	gtkclist.h and gtktypeutils.h.

	* configure.in: removed gtk-doc.spec from AC_OUTPUT, as	whoever wrote
	this forgot to add gtk-doc.spec.in to CVS.
	* Makefile.am: commented out gtk-doc.spec.

Wed Aug 18 03:55:30 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in: Propagate fix from gtkdoc-mkdb.in.
	:-(; need to libraryize, need to libraryize.

Wed Aug 18 03:55:30 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in: Fix bug that was preventing
	structure field definitions from being output.

Wed Aug 18 23:25:23 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: Add /usr/lib/sgml/stylesheet to list
	of stylesheet directories. (Found in recent Debian
	packages)

1999-08-15  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in: Output $decl_out as the struct rather than the
	original $declaration.

1999-08-12  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in: 
	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in: Added special case in ParseEnumDeclaration to
	handle GIOCondition which uses strange macros like this:
	typedef enum
	{
	  G_IO_IN	GLIB_SYSDEF_POLLIN,
	  ...
	The GLIB_SYSDEF_POLLIN macro expands to something like '=1'

1999-08-05  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* gtk-doc.dsl.in: output <br clear=all> after sections and at end of
	page so that right-aligned images aren't messed up quite as much.

Wed Aug  4 04:04:55 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-mk{db,tmpl}.in (ParseStructDeclaration): Allow
	for bit fields.

	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in (ReadObjectHierarchy): Remove
	call to MakeXref that slipped in accidentally.

Wed Aug  4 03:30:19 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* doc/style-guide.txt: Removed references to creating
	tables explicitely in favor of demonstrating new
	syntax. Added a short section on /<* public >*/
	and /*< private *>/.

Wed Aug  4 03:15:19 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in gtkdoc-mkhtml.in: Handle Struct and
	Enumerations in approximately the same way as we
	handle parameters. That is, instead of (as before)
	coding in the tables by hand, one uses lines like:

	@width: the width of the rectangle in pixels.

	To support migration from the older hand-coded
	tables, if none of the members of a structure or
	enumeration have a description in a @... line, then
	we don't generate the table at all.

	Also, gtkdoc-mktmpl now loads up the object heirarchy,
	because we need to be able to check if structures
	are widget structures.

	In general, the coding here is pretty clean, though
	the style is a little different. (I'm interating
	through strings with m/.../msg; instead of 
	s/^...//; for one thing.) However, there are a some
	of FIXME's where I've whimped out on try to handle
	real C syntax, and the need to split out and librarize
	a bunch of duplicated code is greater than ever.

1999-06-06  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* configure.in: updated version to 0.3.

	* doc/style-guide.txt: A couple of minor changes.

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in: Get rid of a couple of messages.
	Output an empty <para> if an Arg isn't documented, to keep Jade happy.

1999-05-22  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* gtk-doc.dsl.in: Renamed %shade-verbatim-attr-2% to
	$shade-verbatim-attr$ and removed our redefinition of
	$verbatim-display$ since the stylesheets version now calls
	$shade-verbatim-attr$ as a function which is just what we wanted.

	* README: Updated info on stylesheet versions supported - 1.40 is
	known to be OK (with this version of gtk-doc), 1.19+ may work.

1999-03-31  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* configure.in: update version to 0.2 for next release.

	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in: 
	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in: added support for 'See Also' section.

	* gtk-doc.dsl.in: changed green background color slightly, and
	set background color for enum tables.

1999-03-21  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* gtkdoc-mkhtml.in (gtkdocdir): use '-w no-idref' to suppress all the
	warnings about references to non-existent IDs.

1999-03-18  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in (OutputParamDescriptions): use role="params" for the
	table so we can adjust the stylesheet code.
	(OutputSGMLFile): Don't output 'one line description goes here'.
	(ExpandAbbreviations): allow '-' in #symbol abbreviations, so we can
	use #GtkWidget-struct.
	(MakeXRef): get rid of special '-struct' suffix, for #GtkWidget-struct.

	* gtk-doc.dsl.in: use the "role" attribute on tables to set the
	BGCOLOR.

	* gtkdoc-scan.in (ScanHeader): fix for scanning functions declared
	over multiple lines - was catching things which weren't functions.

1999-03-11  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* examples/gnomeui/Makefile.am (clean-local): 
	* examples/gnome/Makefile.am (clean-local): added *.args

	* gtkdoc-mkdb.in: added support for Args and variables. Also a few
	minor changes in the output, e.g. don't show macros > 2 lines long.

	* gtkdoc-mktmpl.in: 
	* gtkdoc-scanobj.in: added support for Args.

	* gtkdoc-scan.in: added support for extern'ed variables. Also
	accept 'extern' before function declarations.

	* gtk-doc.dsl.in: made output prettier. Changed the navigation bars
	and the colours used for the various backgrounds.

	* doc/style-guide.txt: new file containinf a style guide for writing
	the GTK+ documentation.

	* doc/README: added description of style-guide.txt

	* doc/setting-up.txt: fixed a typo

	* README: added a bit about Args.

1999-02-07  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Makefile.am: Removed all the scripts from EXTRA_DIST, as they are
	now generated from the .in files which automatically go in the dist.

1999-02-02  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* doc/setting-up.txt (scan): removed text which incorrectly said that
	changing section titles means you have to recreate the main SGML file.

1999-02-03  Sebastian Wilhelmi  <wilhelmi@ira.uka.de>
	
	* configure.in: find perl in $PATH, generate the perl programs
	from their *.in counterparts.
	
	* gtkdoc-fixxref, gtkdoc-mkdb, gtkdoc-mktmpl, gtkdoc-scan,
	gtkdoc-scanobj: Renamed to *.in and changed /usr/bin/perl to
	@PERL@, as determined by configure.
	
	* .cvsignore: Added diverse config* stuff and the new generated
	perl programs.

1999-01-28  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* gtk-doc.dsl.in: I forgot to make the new refentry code process the
	child elements, so it was only outputting anchors for each page.

	* doc/setting-up.txt (scan): added step to create MODULE.types file
	for modules which contain widgets (or objects).

	* gtkdoc-mkdb (OutputStruct): allow spaces inside the public/private
	markers, e.g. "/*  <  public  >  */"

1999-01-27  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Makefile.am: added scripts to EXTRA_DIST and copied examples, doc
	and db2man dirs in dist-hook.

	* doc/sections-file.txt: added a couple of examples.

	* doc/setting-up.txt: new document describing how to set up a module
	to use gtk-doc.

	* doc/README: added description of setting-up.txt

	* README: added short 'Installation' section describing the
	--with-dsssl-dir option.

	* gtk-doc.dsl.in: also output links to each RefEntry page in the
	index.sgml file, so libgnomeui docs can link to widgets. (The widget
	hierarchy links were not working before.)

1999-01-26  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* gtkdoc-scan (ScanHeader): parse function declarations that have the
	return type and name on one line, and the '(' and args on the next.
	NOTE: functions with the start of the declaration split over 3 lines
	will not be parsed (e.g. return type on one line, function name on
	next, and '(' and first argument on the third.) I hope there aren't
	any.

	* gtkdoc-mkdb (OutputStruct): Use a different SGML ID for widget
	structs, since the original ID is used for the entire RefEntry.
	Also only show parts of widget structs which are marked with a
	comment '/*<public>*/'. Use '/*<private>*/' for private fields.

	* gtkdoc-mktmpl (UpdateTemplates): We include widget structs now,
	so we do want warnings if they aren't used.

	* examples/gnomeui/gnomeui-docs.sgml: 
	* examples/gnomeui/gnomeui-sections.txt:
	* examples/gnomeui/gnomeui.types:
	* examples/gnome/gnome-docs.sgml: 
	* examples/gnome/gnome-sections.txt: sync with latest source.

	* examples/configure.in: Add --with-gnome-libs-dir option, so it can
	be configured easily.
	* examples/gnomeui/Makefile.am (DOC_SOURCE_DIR): 
	* examples/gnome/Makefile.am (DOC_SOURCE_DIR): use the new
	GNOME_LIBS_DIR.

	* gtkdoc-mkdb (MergeSourceDocumentation): accept parameters names in
	the source which use the wrong case, since there are quite a few of
	these in Gnome.

1999-01-25  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* gtkdoc-mktmpl: parse G_GNUC_EXTENSION before typedef'ed types.

	* gtkdoc-mkdb: added support for specifying include files in the
	MODULE-sections.txt file, to be	output at the top of the synopsis.

	* doc/sections-file.txt: added description of <INCLUDE> tag.

	* examples/gnomeui/gnomeui-sections.txt: 
	* examples/gnome/gnome-sections.txt: added use of <INCLUDE>

	* examples/configure.in: changed 'gtk-reference' to
	'gnome-libs-reference'.

1999-01-18  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* README: updated my email address & noted that version 1.15+ of the
	DocBook modular stylesheets is needed (for $table-width$).

	* AUTHORS: updated my email address.

1998-12-20  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* examples/gnomeui/gnomeui-docs.sgml,
	  examples/gnomeui/gnomeui-sections.txt,
	  examples/gnomeui/gnomeui.types:
	s/gtkspell/gnome-spell/g

1998-12-16  Damon Chaplin  <DAChaplin@msn.com>

	* gtkdoc-mkdb (ExpandAbbreviations): Allow -ve contants, e.g. %-1.
	(ScanSourceFile): Try to handle function descriptions that start
	with 'Returns'. It was assuming that they were describing the return
	value before.
	Gets rid of 'Description:' which is sometimes included
	at the start of the function description in the source comment blocks.
	Makes sure newlines are preserved in the description, as consecutive
	newlines are converted to paragraph separators later.

1998-12-15  Damon Chaplin  <DAChaplin@msn.com>
	* Major changes to the scripts to merge in comments within source code
	* gtk-doc-fixxref added
	* examples directory added with an example for setting up modules to
	use gtk-doc
	* documentation updated
	

1998-11-28  Damon Chaplin  <DAChaplin@msn.com>

	* gtkdoc-scanobj: 
	* gtkdoc-scan: 
	* gtkdoc-mktmpl: 
	* gtkdoc-mkdb: Major changes to make it easy to update the docs
	when the API changes. It's pretty much all automatic now.
	Also added licenses and function comments, and added 'use strict'.
	The Gnome widgets should now be visible in the hierarchy.
	Removed a few 'mkdir's which I don't think are necessary now.
	
Tue Nov 24 16:32:23 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* README doc/authors.txt: Updated to describe the
	new generic scripts instead of the old ones hard-coded
	for GLIB and GTK+.

Tue Nov 24 01:06:17 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* .cvsignore: Added .cvsignore

Tue Nov 24 01:03:47 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* autogen.sh configure.in: Minor touchups so the newly
	imported stuff autogen's correctly.
