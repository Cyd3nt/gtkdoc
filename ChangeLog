1999-01-28  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* gtk-doc.dsl.in: I forgot to make the new refentry code process the
	child elements, so it was only outputting anchors for each page.

	* doc/setting-up.txt (scan): added step to create MODULE.types file
	for modules which contain widgets (or objects).

	* gtkdoc-mkdb (OutputStruct): allow spaces inside the public/private
	markers, e.g. "/*  <  public  >  */"

1999-01-27  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Makefile.am: added scripts to EXTRA_DIST and copied examples, doc
	and db2man dirs in dist-hook.

	* doc/sections-file.txt: added a couple of examples.

	* doc/setting-up.txt: new document describing how to set up a module
	to use gtk-doc.

	* doc/README: added description of setting-up.txt

	* README: added short 'Installation' section describing the
	--with-dsssl-dir option.

	* gtk-doc.dsl.in: also output links to each RefEntry page in the
	index.sgml file, so libgnomeui docs can link to widgets. (The widget
	hierarchy links were not working before.)

1999-01-26  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* gtkdoc-scan (ScanHeader): parse function declarations that have the
	return type and name on one line, and the '(' and args on the next.
	NOTE: functions with the start of the declaration split over 3 lines
	will not be parsed (e.g. return type on one line, function name on
	next, and '(' and first argument on the third.) I hope there aren't
	any.

	* gtkdoc-mkdb (OutputStruct): Use a different SGML ID for widget
	structs, since the original ID is used for the entire RefEntry.
	Also only show parts of widget structs which are marked with a
	comment '/*<public>*/'. Use '/*<private>*/' for private fields.

	* gtkdoc-mktmpl (UpdateTemplates): We include widget structs now,
	so we do want warnings if they aren't used.

	* examples/gnomeui/gnomeui-docs.sgml: 
	* examples/gnomeui/gnomeui-sections.txt:
	* examples/gnomeui/gnomeui.types:
	* examples/gnome/gnome-docs.sgml: 
	* examples/gnome/gnome-sections.txt: sync with latest source.

	* examples/configure.in: Add --with-gnome-libs-dir option, so it can
	be configured easily.
	* examples/gnomeui/Makefile.am (DOC_SOURCE_DIR): 
	* examples/gnome/Makefile.am (DOC_SOURCE_DIR): use the new
	GNOME_LIBS_DIR.

	* gtkdoc-mkdb (MergeSourceDocumentation): accept parameters names in
	the source which use the wrong case, since there are quite a few of
	these in Gnome.

1999-01-25  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* gtkdoc-mktmpl: parse G_GNUC_EXTENSION before typedef'ed types.

	* gtkdoc-mkdb: added support for specifying include files in the
	MODULE-sections.txt file, to be	output at the top of the synopsis.

	* doc/sections-file.txt: added description of <INCLUDE> tag.

	* examples/gnomeui/gnomeui-sections.txt: 
	* examples/gnome/gnome-sections.txt: added use of <INCLUDE>

	* examples/configure.in: changed 'gtk-reference' to
	'gnome-libs-reference'.

1999-01-18  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* README: updated my email address & noted that version 1.15+ of the
	DocBook modular stylesheets is needed (for $table-width$).

	* AUTHORS: updated my email address.

1998-12-20  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* examples/gnomeui/gnomeui-docs.sgml,
	  examples/gnomeui/gnomeui-sections.txt,
	  examples/gnomeui/gnomeui.types:
	s/gtkspell/gnome-spell/g

1998-12-16  Damon Chaplin  <DAChaplin@msn.com>

	* gtkdoc-mkdb (ExpandAbbreviations): Allow -ve contants, e.g. %-1.
	(ScanSourceFile): Try to handle function descriptions that start
	with 'Returns'. It was assuming that they were describing the return
	value before.
	Gets rid of 'Description:' which is sometimes included
	at the start of the function description in the source comment blocks.
	Makes sure newlines are preserved in the description, as consecutive
	newlines are converted to paragraph separators later.

1998-12-15  Damon Chaplin  <DAChaplin@msn.com>
	* Major changes to the scripts to merge in comments within source code
	* gtk-doc-fixxref added
	* examples directory added with an example for setting up modules to
	use gtk-doc
	* documentation updated
	

1998-11-28  Damon Chaplin  <DAChaplin@msn.com>

	* gtkdoc-scanobj: 
	* gtkdoc-scan: 
	* gtkdoc-mktmpl: 
	* gtkdoc-mkdb: Major changes to make it easy to update the docs
	when the API changes. It's pretty much all automatic now.
	Also added licenses and function comments, and added 'use strict'.
	The Gnome widgets should now be visible in the hierarchy.
	Removed a few 'mkdir's which I don't think are necessary now.

	* README doc/authors.txt: Updated to describe the
	new generic scripts instead of the old ones hard-coded
	for GLIB and GTK+.

Tue Nov 24 01:06:17 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* .cvsignore: Added .cvsignore

Tue Nov 24 01:03:47 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* autogen.sh configure.in: Minor touchups so the newly
	imported stuff autogen's correctly.
