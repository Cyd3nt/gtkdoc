	* gtkdoc-scanobj: 
	* gtkdoc-scan: 
	* gtkdoc-mktmpl: 
	* gtkdoc-mkdb: Major changes to make it easy to update the docs
	when the API changes. It's pretty much all automatic now.
	Also added licenses and function comments, and added 'use strict'.
	The Gnome widgets should now be visible in the hierarchy.
	Removed a few 'mkdir's which I don't think are necessary now.
