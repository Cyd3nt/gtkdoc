	* gtkdoc-mkdb (ExpandAbbreviations): Allow -ve contants, e.g. %-1.
	(ScanSourceFile): Try to handle function descriptions that start
	with 'Returns'. It was assuming that they were describing the return
	value before.
	Gets rid of 'Description:' which is sometimes included
	at the start of the function description in the source comment blocks.
	Makes sure newlines are preserved in the description, as consecutive
	newlines are converted to paragraph separators later.

	* gtkdoc-scanobj: 
	* gtkdoc-scan: 
	* gtkdoc-mktmpl: 
	* gtkdoc-mkdb: Major changes to make it easy to update the docs
	when the API changes. It's pretty much all automatic now.
	Also added licenses and function comments, and added 'use strict'.
	The Gnome widgets should now be visible in the hierarchy.
	Removed a few 'mkdir's which I don't think are necessary now.
