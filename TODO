Developer can also add items here :)

= Tracing =
* there is a bunch of #print statements for tracing
  => add a sub Trace() to gtkdoc-common.pl
  => use @TRACE@ "..." and depending on configure flag
     turn that into
       [print __FILE__ . ":" . __LINE__ . ":" . ] or [#]
     should be a function and the function should support loglevels and an
       envar to enable/disable conditionally;

= More abbreviations =
* expand urls

= Testing =
cd test/gobject
diff -u --exclude="Makefile*" docs docs-tmpl | diffstat

= Issues =
* gtkdoc-fixxref makefile targets use $HTML_DIR
  * HTML_DIR: The directory where gtk-doc generated documentation is installed
  * automake exports $htmldir which is by default:
    ${prefix}/share/doc/${PACKAGE_TARNAME}
  * the Makefile uses $(DESTDIR)$(TARGET_DIR)
    where TARGET_DIR = $(HTML_DIR)/$(DOC_MODULE)
