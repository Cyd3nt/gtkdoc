Developers can also add items here :)

= Tracing =
* there is a bunch of #print statements for tracing
  => add a sub Trace() to gtkdoc-common.pl
  => use @TRACE@ "..." and depending on configure flag
     turn that into
       [print __FILE__ . ":" . __LINE__ . ":" . ] or [#]
     should be a function and the function should support loglevels and an
       envar to enable/disable conditionally;

= More abbreviations =
* expand urls

= Testing =
cd test/gobject
diff -u --exclude="Makefile*" docs docs-tmpl | diffstat

= Issues =
* gtkdoc-fixxref makefile targets use $HTML_DIR
  * HTML_DIR: The directory where gtk-doc generated documentation is installed
    it comes from gtk-doc.m4 (--with-html-dir) but has no default
  * automake exports $htmldir which is by default:
    ${prefix}/share/doc/${PACKAGE_TARNAME}
  * the Makefile uses $(DESTDIR)$(TARGET_DIR)
    where TARGET_DIR = $(HTML_DIR)/$(DOC_MODULE)
    http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/automake/DESTDIR.html

= Output =
* multipage-html
  * would be good to be able to have page titles as a concatenation of document
    name and page name (gtk+:GtkWIdget)
* formats
  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=531572
  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=466535
  we need more configure options in gtk-doc.m4:
  --(enable|disable)-gtk-doc-(html|pdf|man|html-single)
  - html : enabled by default
  - html-single : is single page html
  
= Cleanup =
* can we deprecate title in the sectionfile and request people to have this in
  the SECTION comment?
