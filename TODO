The TODO list for the gtk-doc project is at Bugzilla,
the bugtracking system of the GNOME project.

Visit
 http://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?product=gtk-doc&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED
to see what is allready requested, or where you can help. :-)

To put an other request on the TODO list, visit
 http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=gtk-doc

Also have a look at
 http://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject/GtkDocFuture
and join discussion about future features.


Developer can also add items here :)
* there is a bunch of #print statements for tracing
  => add a sub Trace() to gtkdoc-common.pl
  => use @TRACE@ "..." and depending on configure flag
     turn that into "print" or "#" (should be a function still and the function should support loglevels and sourcefile/line logs);
