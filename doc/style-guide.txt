GTK+ Reference Documentation Style Guide
========================================

This file describes the way the GTK+ reference documentation should be written,
so that we produce consistent documentation.

We will also designate one or two of the template files as 'model' templates,
i.e. they are to be taken as the 'correct' way to write the documentation.


Language
========

Use American spelling rather than British, i.e. color rather than colour,
organize rather than organise etc.


Organizing Sections
===================

The organization of the sections is determined by the glib-sections.txt,
gdk-sections.txt and gtk-sections.txt files.

Group related functions/macros/enums etc. and place a "<SUBSECTION>" tag
(on its own line) between groups. This results in a blank line in the synopsis
between the groups, which makes it a bit easier to read.

Order the groups sections by placing the most important/commonly-used
functions/macros etc. first. For pairs of accessor functions place them
together with the 'get' function first and then the 'set' function.

Private functions etc. should be placed at the end of the "<SECTION>",
after a "<SUBSECTION Private>" line. They will not appear in the HTML output
and they do not have to be documented (they will disappear form the template
files the next time 'make templates' is run).

Enumerations should appear after the first function which uses them.


Functions & Macro Descriptions
==============================

Start the description with a phrase like this:
  'Looks up a key in a GHashTable'.
i.e. assume that 'This function' (or 'This macro') precedes it.


Function Parameters
===================

For object-oriented code, denote the object parameter with 'a',
e.g. 'a #GHashTable'.

Use 'the' for the rest of the parameters.


Widget Structs
==============

Some widget structs have fields which are useful to the developer, since
there are currently no accessor functions to retrieve the particular field.

These fields should be documented by using a table, Copy this
and change the <structfield> and <entry> contents:

<informaltable pgwide=1 frame="none" role="struct">
<tgroup cols="2"><colspec colwidth="2*"><colspec colwidth="8*">
<tbody>

<row>
<entry><structfield>GTK_ARROW_UP</structfield></entry>
<entry>an arrow pointing up.</entry>
</row>

<row>
<entry><structfield>GTK_ARROW_DOWN</structfield></entry>
<entry>an arrow pointing down.</entry>
</row>

</tbody></tgroup></informaltable>


Enumerations
============

A lot of the enumerations in GTK+ are currently placed in the "Standard
Enumerations" section. However, some of these are specific to a particular
widget and so should be moved to the widget's section and documented there.

The enumeration values should be documented with a table. Copy this
and change the <symbol> and <entry> contents:

<informaltable pgwide=1 frame="none" role="enum">
<tgroup cols="2"><colspec colwidth="2*"><colspec colwidth="8*">
<tbody>

<row>
<entry><symbol>GTK_ARROW_UP</symbol></entry>
<entry>an arrow pointing up.</entry>
</row>

<row>
<entry><symbol>GTK_ARROW_DOWN</symbol></entry>
<entry>an arrow pointing down.</entry>
</row>

</tbody></tgroup></informaltable>
