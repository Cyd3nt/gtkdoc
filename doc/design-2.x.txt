= gtk-doc-2.X =
This documents purpose is to collect what needs to be changed for a potential
gtk-doc-2.X.

== remove and deprecate =
- get rid of anything related to tmpl (gtkdoc-mktmpl, the makefile rules, ..)
- get rid of sgml, we will only use docbook xml
- rename generated index.sgml to something like index.idx - it is not wellformed
  sgml

== design fixes ==
=== proper xml-id namesspaces ===
We need proper xml-id namesspaces for document structure and symbols to avoid
clashes e.g. between GtkWidget as a section and as a struct. Normal symbols
should only be mangled to be a valid xml-id. Document structure ids should 
contain a prefix.

These are the rules according to http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#type-id:
"ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by
 any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons
 (":"), and periods (".")."
 
So we could easily use "DOC:" as a prefix for document structure ids.
